query
-------
* datalog-style assertions
    * relations between members
    * "existence" queries
* query on syntactic things (# args written)

display query
-----------------
* elide label
* change label
* minimap
* line graph (a-la chrome profiler)
* overlapping colors
* icons instead of colors
* dynamic highlighting (mouse over, show same args)
* texture

writing experience
------------------------
* auto-tag anonymous functions
* boxes to turn queries on/off (like ray's tests)
* testing interface for running (vivide, ray)
* legend of covered aspects

* data-heavy programs
* the y-combinator
* recursive descent parser
* packrat parser

** isError is incorrect (not all throws are bad)

performance
-----------------

calculate x, y, w, h from bottom up, memoized
